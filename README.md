[rules](https://www.pagat.com/invented/gofish_vars.html)

1.	Play with a standard 52-card deck. Deal 7 cards to every player. Any pairs in players' hands can be scored immediately and then discarded.
2.	Play like standard Go-Fish except that pairs (not sets of 4) count. Any pairs you form are scored and then discarded. If you ask for a card of a particular rank, you must hold a card of that rank. If your request is successful, you must put the pair on the table.
3.	If your request is not successful but you draw a card of the same rank you had asked for, your turn continues. You must put the pair on the table.
4.	If your request is not successful but you draw a card of a rank different from the rank you had asked for, your turn ends. If the card drawn creates a pair, you can score the pair and discard them.
5.	If you run out of cards before the game ends (which will happen if you pair your last card by asking for it or drawing it from the stock), you draw 7 from the stock (or the remainder of the stock if there are 7 or fewer cards in it) to replenish your hand. Your turn then continues.
6.	If it is not your turn to ask and you run out of cards (which will happen if a player asks for your last card), draw 7 from the stock (or the remainder of the stock if there are 7 or fewer cards in it) to replenish your hand. That other player's turn continues.
7.	If the stock runs out, the game continues until all the cards have been paired. If your request for a card is not successful, your turn ends and the next player's turn begins. If you run out of cards when the stock is gone (whether it is your turn to ask or not), then you cannot play any longer in the hand.
8.	All other pairs are 1 point each.
9.	The player with the most points wins.
